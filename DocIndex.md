`CNUserNotification` is a kind of proxy to give OS X Lion 10.7 *the same* support for user notifications like OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 does. It uses a fake notification center that runs just per application. The class design and all method signatures are similar to their counterparts of `NSUserNotification`.
